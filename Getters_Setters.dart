}

// Explanation:
// Private Properties:
// The properties _width and _height are private indicated by the underscore _ at the beginning of their names. 
//This means they can't be accessed directly from outside the class.


// Getters:
// The get keyword is used to define a getter. In this case, the width getter returns the value of the _width property.
// The area getter is a computed property; it doesn't store a value but instead calculates and returns the area based on the width and height.
// Setters:
// The set keyword is used to define a setter. The width setter checks if the value is greater than zero before setting the _width property. If the value is invalid, it prints an error message.

// Using Getters and Setters:
// In the main function, you can see how to use the setters to assign values to the properties and the getters to retrieve those values.

// Benefits of Getters and Setters:
// Encapsulation: They allow you to control how properties are accessed or modified, enforcing any necessary validation or computation.
// Read-Only Properties: By providing only a getter without a setter, you can make a property read-only.
// Computed Properties: Getters can be used to create computed properties, where the value is calculated dynamically rather than stored.

// Key Points:
// Getters and setters can be used to add logic around getting or setting a propertyâ€™s value, such as validation.
// They can help maintain the integrity of the data within your objects by restricting direct access to private fields.
